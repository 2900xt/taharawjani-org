# Two words
Regular Decision. If you think you're ready, think again. 14 FUCKING SCHOOLS. Each of them with 6-7 FUCKING ESSAYS each. 

# Getting edged by EA
So, let me get this straight, literally every single college releases EA/ED results in December. But, for some cruel reason, UVA, UIUC, and GT release their decisions in late Jan. WHY? It's not like you can't review them fast enough - we all know you guys just look at stats and press a button.

Moreover, MIT, glorious MIT, decides to release their results mid-december??? So, in the middle of the trenches of my RD applications, I get to get dejected and get at an even lower point?

# Peer pressure & competition
RD is raw, sweaty competition. You're no longer safe from competing with your classmates (since you guys probably applied to different EDs/REAs). No, this is where people's true colors are shown: people you thought were your day ones start making passive-aggressive comments (to not apply to "their" schools). 

Even if we try to be supportive, we're all thinking about how to get an edge up on our friends and classmates, as they are, in basic terms, our comp. What makes RD completely different in vibes compared to EA is the fact that now you gotta FIGHT for EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL you apply to. It's a coin toss. Unpredictable. It's like Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (the more you think about your chances, the more uncertain you are).

I mean, you can't even show other people your activities, honors, and stats anymore. I hate this. Like, why do we have to "compete"??? If I show ANYONE my college list, it makes them feel bad, and I guess I feel the same way when someone else is applying to a program that I know I "deserve" more.

But, who the fuck do I think I am to know who deserves a school? Why are my friendships turning into **r/chanceme**??

And colleges know this too. Y'all do realize that there are no "quotas" per-school? Sure, there might be some quotas from your ENTIRE STATE or REGION, but that means that multiple kids can get in. By competing, both of yall's chances decrease, whereas if you collaborated, who fucking cares what college you go to, right? You can help each other and become close friends, and as the saying goes "bros before books".

# Technoblade

A legend. You're wondering: how?? This dude sat in his room and made minecraft videos. It's been more than four years since he last uploaded.

NO. Fuck you. He's the fucking goat. He's a goddamn philosopher. So today, I'll present to you what technoblade stood for, and how you and I should should strive to follow his morals in the new 'gilded age'.

# Mentality

Technoblade stood the grind mentality. Sure, one can claim that he was talented, because he was. But talent isn't enough. Nowadays, talent gets you nothing more than McDonalds. What exactly did he do?
* The first example is the Great Potato War. Bro legit pulled off 12+ hours of farming **DAILY**. His farm wasn't magically boosted by the admins, no. He did micro-optimization and reverse-engineered Hypixel algorithms to gain an edge. He won, simply because he put in the hours, optimized harder, and committed beyond what anyone else thought was reasonable. 

> Technoblade Never Dies

You've probably heard this quote before. I'll tell you why it's true: Technoblade never dies because he's the most prepared. On the dream SMP, he farmed 10 entire suits of netherite armor. On Bedwars, he spent thousands of hours practicing his craft before getting the world record. His initial videos were buns, but through preparation, they got funnier. Yes, there's talent, but the undeniable lesson is that success comes from obsessive preparation, not innate abillity.

# A Principal of Authenticity

Technoblade was loyal. To his friends, yes. But most importantly, to his principles.

> “Tommy, you just did a coup. You just did a hostile government takeover and then immediately instilled yourself as president. And then you gave it to your friend, but that's still a tyrant, Tommy! [...] But the thing about this world, Tommy... is that good things don't happen to heroes. Let me tell you a story, Tommy. A story of a man called Theseus. His country... well his city-state, technically, was in danger. And he sent himself forward into enemy lines, he slayed the minotaur, and saved his city. Do you know what they did to him? [...] They exiled him. He died, in disgrace, despised by his people. That's what happens to heroes, Tommy.”

That's an excerpt from the Dream SMP - "The Fall of Manburg". He famously betrayed his closest ally, to uphold his anti-government stance. It's quite poetic. 

Techno's content style of dry humor didn't change to "fit into" the cringe Epstien-flavored minecraft youtubers at the time. He didn't care to chase the algorithm. He did whatever the fuck he felt like. No sponsorships, just random airplane plushies. In a world full of AI slop and 'nonchalant' people, I believe that authenticity is the key. It's how you get trust. The human element. That's what makes Technoblade still popular in the big 26.

> "Loyalty is a two-way street. If I'm asking for it from you, then you're getting it from me" - Harvey Specter, Suits

In return, Techno's fanbase trusted him completely. He got featured in the Minecraft movie - not Dream, not Camman18.

# Humor and Dignity in the Face of Adversity

Even while battling cancer, Technoblade didn't fail to crack the most unfunny jokes. His final video's title was *so long nerds*, with it being like 50% jokes. You can express serious things without letting it strip your sense of identity or humor. 

Whenever life kicks you down onto the ground, take a step back and laugh at yourself. Here's some techno quotes:

> "Now I know what your gonna say, Technoblade you monster, you really just killed millions of your own kind just to make a sword? And look, look, look come on now you gotta understand, there was nothing else I could do I was mildly inconvenienced"

> "But what I found shocked me to my very core. No, no this can’t be. This man, he made 8 potato 11 minions, and then he PAINTED THE MONO-LISA!"

> "I’m an atheist but when god sends me to hell, I want him to hesitate."

> "We got my boy Jacob here. He mines cobblestone for me all day, I don't pay him and he also has no rights. Oh but Technoblade doesn't that kind of sound like... Shhh I need Cobblestone."

# So what?

Yesterday, I got cooked. Rejected from three schools. So, I took a step back... and started laughing. Then, I checked my phone. My friends all got in. My classmates. My day ones. I wasn't fine. To be honest, it's been an extremely disheartening experience. However, you gotta stick to your principles. I know that if I'd been lucky yesterday, my friends would have celebrated with me too, regardless of their outcomes. We celebrated. Most of them don't even know I didn't get in yet. I don't care. I never wanted validation anyways.

We all worked hard, but in the end of it, life is life, and we gotta move on. Technoblade taught me to step back, stick to my principles, laught at myself, and then get back to locking in.

Like I said, he's a goddamn philosopher.
